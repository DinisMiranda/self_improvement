# How to contribute

This repository is mainly **personal** (reference notes and guides), but suggestions and corrections are welcome.

## How to suggest changes

1. **Issues** — Open an [issue](https://github.com/DinisMiranda/self_improvement/issues) to propose a new guide, correction, or improvement. Describe what you want to change or add.
2. **Pull requests** — If you want to edit directly:
   - Fork the repository.
   - Create a branch for your change (e.g. `docs/new-docker-guide`).
   - Make your changes and commit with a clear message (you can use [Conventional Commits](docs/git/conventional-commits.md), e.g. `docs: add Docker reference`).
   - Open a pull request to the `main` branch describing what you did.

## Style

- Guides are in **English**; code examples and conventions (e.g. commit message examples) stay in English.
- Keep the current format: clear headings, tables and lists where they help readability.

Thanks for contributing.
